I saw [this](https://forum.cfx.re/t/paid-standalone-headfriend-gta-hub-inspired-friend-system/5102111) yesterday and decided to remake it and post it for free. The idea is kind of interesting, but I couldn't imagine selling it, much less selling it as escrowed. This whole thing is a meme, and is 95% made up of free resources made by others. Honestly, this seems like a waste of CPU cycles and you should save the disk space by not even bothering downloading this.

**Features**
* Make "fwenships" with other players to see some name above their head. I guess that's cool to some people??
* Customizable, because it's open source. Have fun.
* Systems adaptable to any framework, because it's open source. Best of luck.
* Modern design, because Overextended made a modern looking UI.
* All for the low, low price of free.
